As such, readers are advised to interpret the results with this context in mind. While they provide valuable insights into the state of the African tourism data ecosystem during that time, they may not account for recent developments, changes, or trends that have emerged after early October 2023. \nTo ensure the most accurate and up-to-date understanding, readers are encouraged to consult more recent sources or datasets in conjunction with this report, especially when making data-driven decisions or strategies based on the findings presented herein. \n\nTo obtain the \u201cEase of Access\u201d scores, we embarked on an exhaustive exploration of the African continent's data availability. Utilizing a comprehensive list of countries as sourced from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), we identified and documented the primary statistical agencies for each nation. Where required, ministries of tourism and central banks were accessed to discern the presence of tourism-specific indicators and datasets. \nThis rigorous process allowed us to amass a robust compilation of resources, detailing every accessible data source. To provide clarity and a comparative framework, we established a scoring system, rating each country's Ease of Access Score to their respective tourism data. In instances where a country's official website directed users to the Open Data for Africa platform, we ensured that indicators hosted on this platform were scrutinized. Conclusively, each nation was attributed an \"Ease of Access Score\", which was then aggregated by region, in alignment with the UNSD's regional designations, to derive overarching statistics and insights.
