      "text": "As the African tourism sector continues to rebound from the seismic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2023 and 2024 marked a period of recovery, resilience, and renewed growth. Across the continent, tourism activity has regained momentum, supported by increasing international arrivals, improving infrastructure, and strategic policymaking aimed at fostering a more sustainable industry. Building on the insights of last year’s inaugural report, the Annual African Tourism Outlook 2024 (AATO 2024) broadens its scope to provide a deeper and more comprehensive view of tourism trends, opportunities, and challenges across Africa. This edition features a wider compilation of information on Africa’s tourism sector, covering key strategic areas, as well as new visualizations, detailed plots and insights to provide a more dynamic and actionable understanding of Africa’s tourism landscape. It seeks not only to inform but also to empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, adopt sustainable practices, and foster meaningful collaboration across the sector."

Through this lens, countries such as Egypt, Morocco, and South Africa are identified as having Established Tourism Industries, showcasing their advanced infrastructure and strong international appeal. Emerging Tourism Industry nations, like Kenya and Mauritius, are experiencing rapid growth, signaling their rising importance in global tourism. The Advancing Tourism Economy category highlights countries like Ghana and Ethiopia, which are steadily developing their tourism potential. Lastly, the Nascent Tourism Market includes countries where tourism remains underdeveloped, offering significant opportunities for investment and growth."

The first group comprises Africa’s top three countries by Total International Arrivals in 2022, as identified by UNWTO data (South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco). These destinations provide a benchmark for understanding high-performing tourism markets. The second group examines Lusophone countries, highlighting demand trends and source markets specific to Portuguese-speaking nations."
